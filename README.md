# Robust-Ensemble-Network-EN-
The novel architecture provides a smart perspective to study unsupervised feature learning and low dimensional feature representation. The EDM learns the discriminative features using deep AutoEncoder (AE) and its distribution modeling based on Gaussian approximation in an optimized and robust way for unsupervised clustering of PE(s).
